[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

What is this extension for?
---------------------------

This is a base library to develop extensions for Content Management System TYPO3. It is based and includes many code of extension "lib". I wrote this extension because I don't like the code design of "lib". For my taste there is too much inheritance, too much dependency and unclear responsibilities between the used classes.
